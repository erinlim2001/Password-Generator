# Password-Generator

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a password generator that would prompt and ask the user to confirm character types they would like to include in their password. This generator takes this information to create a password based on the number of characters the user selected, and whether or not they would like to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters. This can allow the user to create a strong password with greater security.
